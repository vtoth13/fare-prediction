        f"significantly influence fares. This suggests that competitive landscapes on different routes play a crucial role in pricing.\n\n"
        f"3. **Demand Influences Price**: The moderate correlation between number of passengers and fare indicates "
        f"that popular routes might command higher prices, possibly due to higher demand.\n\n"
        f"4. **Temporal Trends**: The correlation with the 'Year' variable suggests that there might be long-term "
        f"trends in fare pricing, possibly reflecting economic changes or industry developments.\n\n"
        f"5. **Complex Interactions**: The parallel plot and PPS analysis reveal complex interactions between variables. "
        f"These non-linear relationships provide additional insights beyond simple correlations.\n\n"
        f"These findings can significantly influence our fare prediction model:\n"
        f"- We should ensure that distance (nsmiles) is a key feature in our model.\n"
        f"- Market share variables should be included to capture competitive dynamics.\n"
        f"- Consider creating interaction terms, especially between distance and passenger numbers.\n"
        f"- Time-based features (like year and quarter) should be included to capture temporal trends.\n"
        f"- Feature engineering, such as creating a 'price per mile' feature, could provide additional insights.\n"
        f"- The PPS analysis highlights potential non-linear relationships that might benefit from more complex modeling techniques.\n\n"
        f"Further analysis could involve segmenting the data by different categories (e.g., short-haul vs long-haul flights) "
